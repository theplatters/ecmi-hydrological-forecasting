We utilized four distinct metrics for the verification of our models. The code employed for this purpose is largely adapted from the existing verification code provided by our tutor. The validation dataset, spanning from 2005 to 2020, was employed for this analysis.

The metrics encompassed the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), offering insights into error magnitudes, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which emphasizes outliers more than MAE. Additionally, we computed $R^2$ values and employed Willmott's Index (WI). For the MAE and RMSE values near 0 indicate a better fit. For the $R^2$ and the WI values close to 1 are prefferable.

Our analysis extended to evaluating deviations from the required confidence interval of $5 , \text{cm}$ over a 5-day period for each model. The results were visualized through scatterplots and tables. Moreover, we examined how the models performed during flood conditions, specifically focusing on the 2006 and 2013 floods. This involved generating line plots that compared model predictions against observed values for the given time period. As a further comparison we also checked a timespan with medium to low water leves, during the June and July 2007.
